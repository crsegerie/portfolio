---
[Graphical Models](https://github.com/clement-bonnet/belief-propagation)
<img src="images/projects/Factorgraph.jpg?raw=true"/>

I worked on the Belief Propagation algorithm, and unified the notations between causal Bayesian graphs and factor graphs.

---
[Bayesian Machine Learning](https://github.com/crsegerie/bayesian_nearest_neighbors)
<img src="images/projects/bayesian_machine_learning.png?raw=true"/>

I've worked on the coherence of the nearest neighbor algorithm with the Bayesian axioms of probability.

[3D Computer Vision](https://github.com/crsegerie/3D-computer-vision)
<img src="images/projects/3D_reconstruction.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this repository, you will find my work done during the course of 3D computer vision. During the last TP, we reconstructed a face in 3D from two photos.

### Neuroimaging

[BCI Competition](https://github.com/crsegerie/bci_competition)
<img src="images/projects/BCI_Compet.jpg?raw=true"/>

Here is a solution to the competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/inria-bci-challenge. This solution would be ranked 4th in the original competition.

---

[fMRI Statistics](https://github.com/crsegerie/project_all_resolution_inference)
<img src="images/projects/all_resolution_inference.PNG?raw=true"/>

In this repository you will find an efficient implementation of the paper all resolution inference for brain imaging. This paper proposes a new methodology to construct brain statistics when using fMRI data. We also use this opportunity to criticize the paper.

---

[EEG Analysis](https://github.com/crsegerie/welcome_duty)
<img src="images/projects/source_reconstruction.PNG?raw=true"/>

In this repo, I apply the methodology of MEG signal analysis using the MNE library.

[Brain Parcellation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VT9Q6qrTlRcIzW2x7wWg_TaFNhuTnKn/view?usp=sharing)
<img src="images/projects/ward_parcellation.png?raw=true"/>
I worked on brain percellation using Ward's statistics.

### Competitions

[KIRO2018](https://github.com/crsegerie/kiro2018)
<img src="images/projects/air_france.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this repository, you will find the winner solution of the KIRO2018, in partnership with air france. We build in an iterative way a solution to the scheduling problem of the air France aircraft fleet.

---

[KIRO2019](https://github.com/crsegerie/kiroptimiste/tree/master)
<img src="images/projects/5G.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this repository, you will find the solution of the winner of the extended competition of KIRO2019. We efficiently build the graph of 5G antennas connected by optical fiber in major French cities.

### Fun

[Biostatistics](pdf/Biostatistics_Exam_Segerie.pdf) 
<img src="images/projects/covid.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this paper written to validate the Biostatistics course, I critique/destroy the statistical methodology used by two highly cited papers written at the beginning of the Covid epidemic.

[Automatic boogie woogie Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11hX10ErHX1yGKVAHHJs4iYjJkjsTXoeZ?usp=sharing)
<img src="images/projects/boogie.png?raw=true"/>

Boogiewoogie is great fun to play on the piano, and it's also pretty easy to automate.

---

[Gestalt Essay](pdf/Course2-SEGERIE-Charbel-Raphael.pdf)
<img src="images/projects/Escher.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this essay, I use concepts from Gestalt psychology to describe the patterns of the birds of Eschers and I play with the attention of the viewer.
